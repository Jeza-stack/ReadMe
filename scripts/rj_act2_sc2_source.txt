Romeo and Juliet: Act II, Scene II
By William Shakespeare
Scene: Capulet’s Orchard
[Enter ROMEO]
ROMEO: He jests (Laughs or makes jokes. Context: Romeo says Mercutio teases about love because he’s never been hurt by it.) at scars that never felt a wound (An injury or pain, here, emotional pain from love. Context: Romeo feels the pain of loving Juliet.).
[JULIET appears above at a window]
But soft (Quiet or hush. Context: Romeo tells himself to be quiet and listen.)! What light through yonder (That, pointing to something far. Context: Refers to Juliet’s window.) window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun. Arise, fair (Beautiful. Context: Describes Juliet as a beautiful sun.) sun, and kill (Outshine or overpower. Context: Juliet’s beauty makes the moon seem dim.) the envious (Jealous. Context: The moon is jealous of Juliet’s beauty.) moon, Who is already sick and pale with grief (Sadness. Context: The moon is sad because Juliet is prettier.), That thou her maid (Servant or follower, here, of the moon goddess Diana. Context: Juliet is compared to a follower of the moon.) art far more fair than she. Be not her maid, since she is envious; Her vestal (Pure or virginal, relating to Diana, goddess of chastity. Context: Describes the moon’s appearance.) livery (Uniform or clothing. Context: The moon’s pale, green light is like a uniform.) is but sick and green (Pale or sickly, not the color. Context: The moon’s light looks weak compared to Juliet.), And none but fools do wear it. Cast (Throw or remove. Context: Romeo wants Juliet to reject the moon’s service.) it off! It is my lady. Oh, it is my love. Oh, that she knew she were (Was, here, wishes she knew. Context: Romeo wishes Juliet knew he loves her.)! She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that? Her eye discourses (Speaks or communicates. Context: Juliet’s eyes seem to “talk” to Romeo.). I will answer it. I am too bold (Brave or forward, here, too forward. Context: Romeo worries he’s being too eager.). 'Tis not to me she speaks. Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven, Having some business, do entreat (Ask or beg. Context: Stars ask Juliet’s eyes to shine for them.) her eyes To twinkle in their spheres (Places in the sky, an old belief that stars were in invisible orbits. Context: Refers to where stars “live.”) till they return. What if her eyes were there, they in her head? The brightness of her cheek would shame (Make look bad by comparison. Context: Juliet’s cheeks are brighter than stars.) those stars As daylight doth a lamp. Her eyes in heaven Would through the airy region (Sky or air. Context: Juliet’s eyes would light up the sky.) stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night. See how she leans her cheek upon her hand. Oh, that I were a glove upon that hand, That I might touch that cheek!
JULIET: Ay me (Oh, alas, an expression of sadness or longing. Context: Juliet sighs, thinking of Romeo.)!
ROMEO: She speaks. O, speak again, bright angel! For thou art As glorious (Beautiful or splendid. Context: Romeo compares Juliet to an angel.) to this night, being o'er my head, As is a wingèd messenger of heaven Unto the white-upturnèd (Looking up with wide, amazed eyes. Context: People look at angels in wonder.) wond'ring eyes Of mortals (Humans. Context: Humans admire heavenly beings like Juliet.) that fall back to gaze on him When he bestrides (Strides over or stands above. Context: The angel moves grandly above clouds.) the lazy-pacing (Slow-moving. Context: Describes the clouds’ gentle movement.) clouds And sails upon the bosom (Chest or surface. Context: The air supports the angel like a chest.) of the air.
JULIET: O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore (Why. Context: Juliet asks why Romeo is a Montague, her enemy.) art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name. Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn (Promised with a vow. Context: Juliet wants Romeo to promise his love.) my love, And I’ll no longer be a Capulet.
ROMEO [Aside]: Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
JULIET: 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy. Thou art thyself, though not a Montague. What’s Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot, Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part Belonging to a man. O, be some other name! What’s in a name? That which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet. So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called, Retain (Keep. Context: Romeo would still be perfect without his name.) that dear perfection which he owes (Owns or has. Context: Romeo has perfection naturally.) Without that title (Name or label. Context: Refers to the name “Montague.”) Romeo, doff (Remove or take off. Context: Juliet wants Romeo to give up his name.) thy name, And for that name, which is no part of thee, Take all myself.
ROMEO: I take thee at thy word. Call me but love, and I’ll be new baptized (Given a new name, like in a religious ceremony. Context: Romeo will take “love” as his new name.). Henceforth (From now on. Context: Romeo promises to abandon his name.) I never will be Romeo.
JULIET: What man art thou that, thus bescreened (Hidden or covered. Context: Romeo is hidden by darkness.) in night, So stumblest (Accidentally come upon. Context: Juliet is surprised Romeo heard her thoughts.) on my counsel (Private thoughts or secrets. Context: Juliet’s private words about Romeo.)?
ROMEO: By a name I know not how to tell thee who I am. My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself Because it is an enemy to thee. Had I it written, I would tear the word.
JULIET: My ears have not yet drunk (Taken in or absorbed. Context: Juliet hasn’t heard much but recognizes Romeo’s voice.) a hundred words Of that tongue’s utterance (Speech or words. Context: Refers to Romeo’s voice.), yet I know the sound. Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?
ROMEO: Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike (Displease or bother. Context: Romeo rejects his name if it upsets Juliet.).
JULIET: How camest thou hither (Here. Context: Juliet asks how Romeo got to her orchard.), tell me, and wherefore? The orchard walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen (Family members. Context: Juliet’s relatives, the Capulets, are Romeo’s enemies.) find thee here.
ROMEO: With love’s light wings did I o’erperch (Fly over or climb over. Context: Romeo says love helped him climb the walls.) these walls, For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can do, that dares love attempt. Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop (Obstacle or barrier. Context: Romeo says the Capulets can’t stop his love.) to me.
JULIET: If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
ROMEO: Alack (Alas or oh no, an expression of sorrow. Context: Romeo acknowledges danger.), there lies more peril (Danger. Context: Juliet’s look is more dangerous to Romeo than swords.) in thine eye Than twenty of their swords. Look thou but sweet, And I am proof (Protected or immune. Context: Juliet’s kind look protects Romeo.) against their enmity (Hatred or hostility. Context: Refers to the Capulets’ hatred for Montagues.).
JULIET: I would not for the world they saw thee here.
ROMEO: I have night’s cloak (A covering or protection. Context: Night hides Romeo from danger.) to hide me from their eyes, And but thou love me, let them find me here. My life were better ended by their hate Than death proroguèd (Delayed or postponed. Context: Romeo prefers death now over life without Juliet’s love.), wanting (Lacking. Context: Romeo doesn’t want to live without Juliet’s love.) of thy love.
JULIET: By whose direction found’st thou out this place?
ROMEO: By love, that first did prompt (Urge or encourage. Context: Love pushed Romeo to find Juliet.) me to inquire (Search or seek. Context: Romeo looked for Juliet’s house.). He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes. I am no pilot (A navigator or guide, like on a ship. Context: Romeo says he’s not skilled but would still find Juliet.), yet, wert thou as far As that vast shore washed with the farthest sea, I would adventure (Risk a journey. Context: Romeo would travel far for Juliet.) for such merchandise (A treasure or prize. Context: Juliet is the valuable prize Romeo seeks.).
JULIET: Thou know’st the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden (A young woman or virgin. Context: Juliet refers to herself as a shy young woman.) blush bepaint (Paint or color. Context: Juliet would blush with embarrassment.) my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight. Fain (Gladly or willingly. Context: Juliet wishes she could act more reserved.) would I dwell on form (Proper behavior or manners. Context: Juliet wants to follow social rules.), fain, fain deny What I have spoke. But farewell compliment (Polite behavior or formality. Context: Juliet rejects politeness to be honest.)! Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say “Ay,” And I will take thy word. Yet if thou swear’st Thou mayst prove false (Untrue or dishonest. Context: Juliet worries Romeo’s love might not be real.). At lovers’ perjuries (Lies or broken promises. Context: Juliet says the god Jove finds lovers’ lies amusing.), They say, Jove (Jupiter, a Roman god. Context: Juliet refers to mythology to talk about love.) laughs. O gentle Romeo, If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully (Honestly or truly. Context: Juliet asks for Romeo’s true feelings.). Or if thou think’st I am too quickly won, I’ll frown and be perverse (Stubborn or contrary. Context: Juliet could act difficult to make Romeo pursue her.) and say thee nay (No. Context: Juliet might refuse Romeo to test him.), So thou wilt woo (Court or seek someone’s love. Context: Juliet could make Romeo work harder for her love.). But else, not for the world. In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond (Affectionate or loving, sometimes foolishly so. Context: Juliet admits she loves Romeo deeply.).
And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior (Behavior or actions. Context: Juliet worries Romeo thinks she’s too forward.) light (Frivolous or not serious. Context: Juliet doesn’t want her love seen as shallow.). But trust me, gentleman, I’ll prove more true Than those that have more coying (Acting shy or reserved. Context: Some women pretend to be distant to seem proper.) to be strange (Distant or reserved. Context: Juliet says she’s more honest than coy women.). I should have been more strange, I must confess, But that thou overheard’st, ere (Before. Context: Romeo heard Juliet before she knew he was there.) I was 'ware (Aware. Context: Juliet didn’t know Romeo was listening.), My true love’s passion. Therefore pardon me, And not impute (Attribute or blame. Context: Juliet asks Romeo not to think her love is shallow.) this yielding (Giving in or agreeing. Context: Juliet’s openness about her love.) to light love, Which the dark night hath so discoverèd (Revealed or shown. Context: The night showed Juliet’s true feelings.).
ROMEO: Lady, by yonder blessèd moon I swear That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops—
JULIET: O, swear not by the moon, th’ inconstant (Changeable or unreliable. Context: The moon changes, so it’s a bad thing to swear by.) moon, That monthly changes in her circled orb (A circle or path, of the moon. Context: Refers to the moon’s changing phases.), Lest that thy love prove likewise variable (Unsteady or changing. Context: Juliet fears Romeo’s love might change like the moon.).
ROMEO: What shall I swear by?
JULIET: Do not swear at all. Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious (Kind or noble. Context: Juliet says Romeo himself is worthy to swear by.) self, Which is the god of my idolatry (Worship or extreme devotion. Context: Juliet “worships” Romeo like a god.), And I’ll believe thee.
ROMEO: If my heart’s dear love—
JULIET: Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract (An agreement or vow. Context: Juliet is unsure about their quick promises.) tonight. It is too rash (Hasty or reckless. Context: Juliet thinks their love is too fast.), too unadvised (Not thought through. Context: Their love lacks careful planning.), too sudden, Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say “It lightens.” Sweet, good night. This bud of love, by summer’s ripening breath, May prove a beauteous (Beautiful. Context: Their love might grow into something beautiful.) flower when next we meet.
Good night, good night! As sweet repose (Rest or sleep. Context: Juliet wishes Romeo peaceful sleep.) and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast!
ROMEO: O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied (Unfulfilled. Context: Romeo wants a vow of love.)?
JULIET: What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?
ROMEO: Th’ exchange of thy love’s faithful vow for mine.
JULIET: I gave thee mine before thou didst request it, And yet I would it were to give again.
ROMEO: Wouldst thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?
JULIET: But to be frank (Honest or generous. Context: Juliet wants to give her love again openly.) and give it thee again. And yet I wish but for the thing I have. My bounty (Generosity or wealth. Context: Juliet’s love is as vast as the sea.) is as boundless (Without limits. Context: Juliet’s love has no end.) as the sea, My love as deep. The more I give to thee, The more I have, for both are infinite (Endless or unlimited. Context: Juliet’s love grows the more she gives.).
[Nurse calls within]
JULIET: I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu (Goodbye, French. Context: Juliet says farewell as she leaves.)!— Anon (Soon or right away. Context: Juliet responds to the Nurse’s call.), good Nurse!—Sweet Montague, be true. Stay but a little. I will come again.
[Exit JULIET]
ROMEO: O blessèd, blessèd night! I am afeard (Afraid. Context: Romeo fears this moment is too good to be real.), Being in night, all this is but a dream, Too flattering (Pleasing but maybe not true. Context: The moment feels like a dream.) sweet to be substantial (Real or solid. Context: Romeo hopes this love is not just a dream.).
[Re-enter JULIET, above]
JULIET: Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy bent (Intention or purpose. Context: Juliet wants Romeo’s love to be serious.) of love be honorable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow By one that I’ll procure (Arrange or get. Context: Juliet will send a messenger.) to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite (Ceremony, here, marriage. Context: Juliet asks about wedding plans.).
And all my fortunes (Wealth or future. Context: Juliet offers everything to Romeo.) at thy foot I’ll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
[Nurse calls within]
NURSE: Madam!
JULIET: I come, anon.—But if thou mean’st not well, I do beseech (Beg or ask earnestly. Context: Juliet asks Romeo to be honest.) thee—
[Nurse calls within]
NURSE: Madam!
JULIET: By and by (Immediately or soon. Context: Juliet responds to the Nurse.), I come!— To cease thy strife (Effort or pursuit. Context: Juliet asks Romeo to stop if he’s not serious.) and leave me to my grief. Tomorrow will I send.
ROMEO: So thrive (Prosper or do well. Context: Romeo hopes his soul succeeds with Juliet’s love.) my soul—
JULIET: A thousand times good night!
[Exit JULIET]
ROMEO: A thousand times the worse to want (Lack or miss. Context: Romeo hates losing Juliet’s presence.) thy light. Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books, But love from love, toward school with heavy looks (Sad or reluctant expressions. Context: Leaving love is like going to school sadly.).
[Re-enter JULIET, above]
JULIET: Hist (Hush or call quietly. Context: Juliet calls Romeo back softly.), Romeo, hist!—O, for a falconer’s (A person who trains falcons. Context: Juliet wishes she could call Romeo like a falcon.) voice, To lure (Attract or call back. Context: Juliet wants to bring Romeo back.) this tassel-gentle (Male falcon, a gentle bird. Context: Juliet compares Romeo to a falcon.) back again! Bondage (Restriction or confinement. Context: Juliet’s situation limits her freedom to speak.) is hoarse (Rough or unable to speak loudly. Context: Juliet can’t call out loudly.) and may not speak aloud, Else would I tear the cave where Echo (A mythical figure whose voice repeats sounds. Context: Juliet would call Romeo’s name repeatedly.) lies And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine With repetition of “My Romeo!”
ROMEO: It is my soul that calls upon my name. How silver-sweet sound lovers’ tongues by night, Like softest music to attending (Listening. Context: Lovers’ voices sound sweet to each other.) ears!
JULIET: Romeo!
ROMEO: My sweet?
JULIET: What o’clock (Time, by the clock. Context: Juliet asks what time to send her messenger.) tomorrow Shall I send to thee?
ROMEO: By the hour of nine.
JULIET: I will not fail. ’Tis twenty year till then. I have forgot why I did call thee back.
ROMEO: Let me stand here till thou remember it.
JULIET: I shall forget, to have thee still stand there, Rememb’ring (Remembering. Context: Juliet loves Romeo’s presence.) how I love thy company.
ROMEO: And I’ll still stay, to have thee still forget, Forgetting any other home but this.
JULIET: ’Tis almost morning. I would have thee gone, And yet no farther than a wanton’s (A spoiled or playful person’s. Context: Juliet compares herself to a child with a pet.) bird, That lets it hop a little from her hand Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves (Shackles or chains. Context: The bird is like a prisoner tied up.), And with a silken thread plucks it back again, So loving-jealous (Loving but protective. Context: Juliet wants Romeo close, like a jealous owner.) of his liberty (Freedom. Context: The bird, Romeo, wants freedom, but Juliet wants him near.).
ROMEO: I would I were thy bird.
JULIET: Sweet, so would I. Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing (Loving or caring too much. Context: Juliet’s love might overwhelm Romeo.). Good night, good night. Parting is such sweet sorrow (Sadness. Context: Leaving is sad but sweet because of their love.) That I shall say good night till it be morrow (Tomorrow. Context: Juliet will keep saying good night until morning.).
[Exit JULIET]
ROMEO: Sleep dwell (Stay or rest. Context: Romeo wishes sleep and peace for Juliet.) upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast. Would I were sleep and peace so sweet to rest. Hence (From here. Context: Romeo will go to the friar.) will I to my ghostly (Spiritual or holy. Context: Refers to Friar Laurence as a spiritual guide.) friar’s close cell (A private room. Context: The friar’s small room for prayer or advice.), His help to crave (Ask for or seek. Context: Romeo will ask the friar for help.), and my dear hap (Luck or fortune. Context: Romeo wants to share his good luck, finding Juliet.) to tell.
[Exit ROMEO]
