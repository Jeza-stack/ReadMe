              "fullText": "Listen, son: I am saying this as you lie asleep, one little paw crumpled under your cheek and the blond curls stickily wet on your damp forehead. I have stolen into your room alone. Just a few minutes ago, as I sat reading my paper in the library, a stifling wave of remorse swept over me. Guiltily I came to your bedside.\n\nThese are the things I was thinking, son: I had been cross to you. I scolded you as you were dressing for school because you gave your face merely a dab with a towel. I took you to task for not cleaning your shoes. I called out angrily when you threw some of your things on the floor.\n\nAt breakfast I found fault, too. You spilled things. You gulped down your food. You put your elbows on the table. You spread butter too thick on your bread. And as you started off to play and I made for my train, you turned and waved a hand and called, 'Goodbye, Daddy!' and I frowned, and said in reply, 'Hold your shoulders back!'\n\nThen it began all over again in the late afternoon. As I came up the road I spied you, down on your knees, playing marbles. There were holes in your stockings. I humiliated you before your boyfriends by marching you ahead of me to the house. Stockings were expensive—and if you had to buy them you would be more careful! Imagine that, son, from a father!\n\nDo you remember, later, when I was reading in the library, how you came in timidly, with a sort of hurt look in your eyes? When I glanced up from my paper, impatient at the interruption, you hesitated at the door. 'What is it you want?' I snapped.\n\nYou said nothing, but ran across in one tempestuous plunge, and threw your arms around my neck and kissed me, and your small arms tightened with an affection that God had set blooming in your heart and which even neglect could not wither. And then you were gone, pattering up the stairs.\n\nWell, son, it was shortly afterwards that my paper slipped from my hands and a terrible sickening fear came over me. What has habit been doing to me? The habit of finding fault, of reprimanding—this was my reward to you for being a boy. It was not that I did not love you; it was that I expected too much of youth. I was measuring you by the yardstick of my own years.\n\nAnd there was so much that was good and fine and true in your character. The little heart of you was as big as the dawn itself over the wide hills. This was shown by your spontaneous impulse to rush in and kiss me good night. Nothing else matters tonight, son. I have come to your bedside in the darkness, and I have knelt there, ashamed!\n\nIt is a feeble atonement; I know you would not understand these things if I told them to you during your waking hours. But tomorrow I will be a real daddy! I will chum with you, and suffer when you suffer, and laugh when you laugh. I will bite my tongue when impatient words come. I will keep saying as if it were a ritual: 'He is nothing but a boy—a little boy!'\n\nI am afraid I have visualized you as a man. Yet as I see you now, son, crumpled and weary in your cot, I see that you are still a baby. Yesterday you were in your mother's arms, your head on her shoulder. I have asked too much, too much.",

              "fullText": "A stout old lady was walking with her basket down the middle of a street in Petrograd to the great confusion of the traffic and with no small peril to herself. It was pointed out to her that the pavement was the place for foot-passengers, but she replied: 'I'm going to walk where I like. We've got liberty now.' It did not occur to the dear old lady that if liberty entitled the foot-passenger to walk down the middle of the road, it also entitled the taxi-driver to drive on the pavement, and that the end of such liberty would be universal chaos.\n\nEverything would be getting in everybody else's way and nobody would get anywhere. Individual liberty would have become social anarchy. There is a danger of the world getting liberty-drunk in these days like the old lady with the basket, and it is just as well to remind ourselves of what is the rule of the road. It means that in order that the liberties of all may be preserved, the liberties of everybody must be curtailed.\n\nWhen the policeman, say, at Piccadilly Circus steps into the middle of the road and puts out his hand, he is the symbol not of tyranny, but of liberty. You may not think so. You may, being in a hurry, and seeing your car pulled up by this insolence of office, feel that your liberty has been violated. How can this fellow interfere with your free use of the public highway? Then, if you are a reasonable person, you will reflect that if he did not interfere with you, he would interfere with no one, and the result would be that Piccadilly Circus would be a maelstrom that you would never cross at all. You have submitted to a curtailment of private liberty in order that you may enjoy a social order which makes your liberty a reality.\n\nLiberty is not a personal affair only, but a social contract. It is an accommodation of interests. In matters which do not touch anybody else's liberty, of course, I may be as free as I like. If I choose to go down the road in a dressing-gown with long hair and bare feet, who shall say me nay? You have liberty to laugh at me, but I have liberty to be indifferent to you. And if I have a fancy for dyeing my hair, or waxing my moustache (which heaven forbid), or wearing an overcoat and sandals, or going to bed late or getting up early, I shall follow my fancy and ask no man's permission.\n\nBut when we step out of that kingdom our personal liberty of action becomes qualified by other people's liberty. I might like to practice on the trombone from midnight till three in the morning. If I went on to the top of Everest to do it, I could please myself, but in my suburban house I have to consider the people in my street. We are all liable to forget this, and unfortunately we are much more conscious of the imperfections of others in this respect than of our own. A reasonable consideration for the rights or feelings of others is the foundation of social conduct. It is in the small matters of conduct, in the observance of the rule of the road, that we pass judgment upon ourselves, and declare that we are civilized or uncivilized.",

His small shop, filled with the gentle ticking of a dozen clocks, was a relic of a bygone era. For fifty years, he had mended timepieces, his life measured by the steady swing of their pendulums. But now, a new sound filled the city: the silent, sterile hum of electric clocks. His customers dwindled, their modern tastes leaving no room for his antiquated art.\n\nHis pride, the great grandfather clock in the corner, was his masterpiece. Its pendulum, a disk of polished brass, swung with a grace that Shibnath called 'the heartbeat of time.' But as his fortunes faltered, so did the clock. Its swings grew weaker, its chimes less certain. Shibnath saw it as a reflection of his own life, a slow, inevitable decline. He refused to sell it, even when his pockets were empty. 'You don't sell a part of your soul,' he'd mutter.\n\nOne day, a wealthy industrialist, a man who built factories that mass-produced the very clocks that were ruining him, came to his shop. He didn't want a new clock; he wanted Shibnath to repair an old, intricate German timepiece, a family heirloom. For weeks, Shibnath worked, his old passion rekindled. He poured all his skill into the task, his hands steady once more. When he was finished, the clock chimed with a clarity it hadn't known in decades.\n\nThe industrialist was overjoyed and paid him a handsome sum. With the money, Shibnath could have modernized his shop, perhaps even retired. Instead, he bought the finest oils and tools. He spent the entire night tending to his own faltering pendulum, polishing the brass, tightening the weights, and tuning the chime. As dawn broke, the grandfather clock rang out, its beat strong and true once more. Shibnath smiled. He hadn't defeated the future, but he had preserved the past, and for a master of time, that was victory enough.",

              "fullText": "When I was a girl of about twelve, I used to stay in a village in north Karnataka with my grandparents. Those days, the transport system was not very good, so we used to get the morning paper only in the afternoon. The weekly magazine used to come one day late. All of us would wait eagerly for the bus, which used to come with the papers, weekly magazines and the post. \n\nAt that time, Triveni was a very popular writer in the Kannada language. She was a wonderful writer. Her style was easy to read and very convincing. Her stories usually dealt with complex psychological problems in the lives of ordinary people and were always very interesting. Unfortunately for Kannada literature, she died very young. Even now, after forty years, people continue to appreciate her novels. \n\nOne of her novels, called 'Kashi Yatre', was appearing as a serial in the Kannada weekly 'Karmaveera' then. It is the story of an old woman and her ardent desire to go to Kashi or Varanasi. Most Hindus believe that going to Kashi and worshipping Lord Vishweshwara is the ultimate punya. This old woman also believed in this, and her struggle to go there was described in this novel. In the story, there was also a young orphan girl who falls in love but there was no money for the wedding. In the end, the old woman gives away all her savings to the girl, without going to Kashi. She says, 'The happiness of this orphan girl is more important than worshipping Lord Vishweshwara at Kashi.' \n\nMy grandmother, Krishtakka, never went to school so she could not read. Every Wednesday, the magazine would come and I would read the next episode of this story to her. During that time, she would forget all her work and listen with the greatest concentration. Later, she could repeat the entire text by heart. My grandmother too never went to Kashi, and she identified herself with the protagonist. So more than anybody else, she was the one most interested in knowing what happened next in the story and used to insist that I read the serial out to her. \n\nAfter listening to the next episode, she would join her friends at the temple courtyard, where we children would also go and play hide-and-seek. She would discuss the latest episode with her friends. At that time, I never understood why she was doing that. I wondered why she should have to remember the previous episode. \n\nOnce I went for a wedding with my cousins to the neighbouring village. In those days, a wedding was a great event. We children enjoyed ourselves thoroughly. We would eat and play endlessly, enjoying the freedom because all the elders were busy. I went for a couple of days but ended up staying there for a week. \n\nWhen I came back to my village, I saw my grandmother in tears. I was surprised, for I had never seen her cry even in the most difficult situations. 'What is the matter?' I asked. 'Avva, is everything all right? Are you okay?' \n\nShe nodded, but did not reply. I did not understand and forgot about it. In the night, after dinner, we were sleeping in the open terrace of the house. It was a summer night and there was a full moon. Avva came and sat next to me. Her affectionate hands touched my forehead. I realised she wanted to speak. I asked her, 'What is the matter?' \n\n'When I was a young girl,' she started, 'I lost my mother. There was nobody to look after and guide me. My father was a busy man and got married again. In those days, people never considered education essential for girls, so I never went to school. I got married at a very young age and had children. I became very busy. Later I had grandchildren and always felt so much happiness in cooking and feeding all of you. At times, I used to regret not going to school, so I made sure that my children and grandchildren studied well...' \n\n'I could see she was crying. I came close to her and held her hand in mine. 'Avva, don't cry. What is the matter? Can I help you in any way?' \n\n'Yes, I need your help. You know when you were away, Karmaveera came as usual. I opened the magazine. I saw the picture that accompanies the story of Kashi Yatre and I could not understand anything that was written. Many times, I rubbed my hands over the pages, wishing I could understand what was written. But I knew it was not possible. If only I was educated enough. I waited eagerly for you to return. I felt you would come early and read for me. I even thought of going to the village and asking you to read for me. I could have asked somebody in this village but I was too embarrassed to do so. I felt so very dependent and helpless. We are well-off, but what use is money when I cannot be independent?' \n\nI did not know what to answer. Avva continued. \n\n'I have decided I want to learn the Kannada alphabet from tomorrow onwards. I will work very hard. I will keep the Saraswati Pooja day during Dussehra as the deadline. That day I should be able to read a novel on my own. I want to be independent.' \n\nI saw the determination on her face. Yet I laughed at her. 'Avva, at this age of sixty-two, you want to learn the alphabet? All your hair is grey, your hands are wrinkled, you wear spectacles and you work so much in the kitchen...' I made fun of the old woman. \n\nBut she just smiled. 'For a good cause, if you are determined, you can overcome any obstacle. I will work harder than anybody but I will do it. For learning, age is no bar.' \n\nThe next day onwards, I started my tuition. Avva was a wonderful student. The amount of homework she did was amazing. She would read, repeat, write and recite. I was her only teacher and she was my first student. Little did I know then that one day I would become a teacher in computer science and teach hundreds of students. \n\nThe Dussehra festival came as usual. Secrets were kept as per the custom. I bought a gift for my grandmother. My grandmother called me to the pooja place and made me sit down on a stool. She gave me a gift. It was a frock material. \n\nThen she did something unusual. She bent down and touched my feet. I was surprised and taken aback. Elders never touch the feet of youngsters. We have always touched the feet of God, elders and teachers. We consider that as a mark of respect. It is a great tradition but today the reverse had happened. It was not correct. \n\nShe said, 'I am touching the feet of a teacher, not my granddaughter. A teacher who taught me so well, with so much of affection that I can read any novel confidently in such a short period. Now I am independent. It is my duty to respect a teacher. Is it not written in our scriptures that a teacher should be respected, irrespective of the gender and age?' \n\nI did not reply, but returned her namaskara by touching her feet. That night I could not sleep. That day she made me proud. The student has passed with flying colours.",

Her mother is often vexed at this, and would stop her prattle, but I would not. To see Mini quiet is unnatural, and I cannot bear it long. And so my own talk with her is always lively.\n\nOne morning, for instance, when I was in the midst of the seventeenth chapter of my new novel, my little Mini stole into the room, and putting her hand into mine, said: 'Father! Ramdayal the doorkeeper calls a crow a krow! He doesn't know anything, does he?'\n\nBefore I could explain to her the differences of language in this world, she was embarked on the full tide of another subject. 'What do you think, Father? Bhola says there is an elephant in the clouds, blowing water out of his trunk, and that is why it rains!'\n\nAnd then, darting off anew, while I was still preparing to reply: 'Father! what relation is Mother to you?'\n\n'My dear little sister in law!' I murmured to myself, but with a grave face contrived to answer: 'Go and play with Bhola, Mini! I am busy!'\n\nThe window of my study looks out on the road. The child had seated herself at my feet near my table, and was playing softly, drumming on her knees. I was hard at work on my seventeenth chapter, where Pratap Singh, the hero, had just caught Kanchanlata, the heroine, in his arms, and was about to escape with her by the third-story window of the castle, when all of a sudden Mini left her play, and ran to the window, crying, 'A Kabuliwala! a Kabuliwala!' And indeed, in the street below, was a Kabuliwala, passing slowly along. He wore the loose, soiled clothing of his people, with a tall turban; there was a bag on his back, and he carried boxes of grapes in his hand.\n\nI cannot tell what were my daughter's feelings at the sight of this man, but she began to call him loudly. 'Ah!' I thought, 'he will come in, and my seventeenth chapter will never be finished!' At which exact moment the Kabuliwala turned, and looked up at the child. When she saw this, she was overcome by terror, and fled to her mother's protection, and disappeared. She had a blind belief that inside the bag, which the big man carried, there were perhaps two or three other children like herself. The pedlar, meanwhile, entered my doorway, and greeted me with a smiling face.\n\nSo precarious was the position of my hero and my heroine, that my first impulse was to stop and buy something, since the man had been called. I made some small purchases, and a conversation began about Abdurrahman, the Russians, the English, and the Frontier Policy.\n\nAs he was about to leave, he asked: 'And where is the little girl, sir?'\n\nAnd I, thinking that Mini must get rid of her false fear, had her brought out.\n\nShe stood by my chair, and looked at the Kabuliwala and his bag. He offered her nuts and raisins, but she would not be tempted, and only clung the closer to me, with all her doubts increased.\n\nThis was their first meeting.\n\nOne morning, however, not many days later, as I was leaving the house, I was startled to find Mini, seated on a bench near the door, laughing and talking, with the great Kabuliwala at her feet. In all her life, it appeared, my small daughter had never found so patient a listener, except her father. And already the corner of her little sari was stuffed with almonds and raisins, the gift of her visitor. 'Why did you give her those?' I said, and taking out an eight-anna bit, I handed it to him. The man accepted the money without demur, and slipped it into his pocket.\n\nAlas, on my return an hour later, I found the unfortunate coin had made twice its own worth of trouble! For the Kabuliwala had given it to Mini; and her mother, catching sight of the bright round object, had pounced on the child with: 'Where did you get that eight-anna bit?'\n\n'The Kabuliwala gave it me,' said Mini cheerfully.\n\n'The Kabuliwala gave it you!' cried her mother much shocked. 'O Mini! how could you take it from him?'\n\nI, entering at the moment, saved her from impending disaster, and proceeded to make my own inquiries.\n\nI found that this was not the first or second time the two had met. The Kabuliwala had overcome the child's first terror by a judicious bribery of nuts and almonds, and the two were now great friends.\n\nThey had many quaint jokes, which afforded them much amusement. Seated in front of him, looking down on his gigantic frame in all her tiny dignity, Mini would ripple her face with laughter, and begin: 'O Kabuliwala, Kabuliwala, what have you got in your bag?'\n\nAnd he would reply, in the nasal accents of the mountaineer: 'An elephant!' Not much cause for merriment, perhaps; but how they both enjoyed the fun! And for me, this child's talk with a grown-up man had always in it something strangely fascinating.\n\nThen the Kabuliwala, not to be behindhand, would take his turn: 'Well, little one, and when are you going to the father-in-law's house?'\n\nNow most small Bengali maidens have heard long ago about the father-in-law's house; but we, being a little new-fangled, had kept these things from our child, and Mini at this question must have been a trifle bewildered. But she would not show it, and with instant composure replied: 'Are you going there?'\n\nAmongst men of the Kabuliwala's class, however, it is well known that the words 'father-in-law's house' have a double meaning. It is a euphemism for jail, the place where we are well cared for, at no expense to ourselves. In this sense would the sturdy pedlar take my daughter's question. 'Ah,' he would say, shaking his fist at an invisible policeman, 'I will thrash my father-in-law!' Hearing this, and picturing the poor discomfited relative, Mini would go off into peals of laughter, in which her formidable friend would join.\n\nThese were autumn mornings, the very time of year when kings of old went forth to conquest; and I, never stirring from my little corner in Calcutta, would let my mind wander over the whole world. At the very name of another country, my heart would go out to it, and at the sight of a foreigner in the streets, I would fall to weaving a network of dreams, —the mountains, the glens, and the forests of his distant home, with his cottage in its setting, and the free and independent life of far-away wilds.\n\nMy wife is of a very timid nature, and she was full of doubts about the Kabuliwala. She was afraid that he might steal her. She would beg me to keep a watchful eye on him.\n\nI tried to laugh her fear gently away, but then she would turn round on me seriously, and ask me solemn questions.\n\n'Were children never stolen?'\n\n'Was it not true that there was slavery in Kabul?'\n\n'Was it so very absurd that this big man should be able to carry off a tiny child?'\n\nI urged that, though not impossible, it was highly improbable. But this was not enough, and her dread persisted. But as it was a very vain fear, I did not think it right to forbid the man the house, and the intimacy went on unchecked.\n\nOnce a year, in the middle of January, Rahamat, the Kabuliwala, was in the habit of returning to his country, and as the time approached he would be very busy, going from house to house collecting his debts. This year, however, he could always find time to come and see Mini. It would have seemed to him that he was cheating himself if he had not done so.\n\nOne morning I was sitting in my study, when I heard an uproar in the street. Looking out, I saw Rahamat being led away by two policemen, and behind them a crowd of curious boys. There were blood-stains on the clothes of the Kabuliwala, and one of the policemen carried a knife. I hurried out and stopped them, and inquired what it all meant. Partly from one, partly from another, I gathered that a certain neighbour had owed the pedlar something for a Rampuri shawl, but had falsely denied having bought it, and that in the course of the quarrel Rahamat had struck him. Now, in the heat of his excitement, the prisoner began calling his enemy all sorts of names.\n\nSuddenly, from a verandah of my house, my little Mini, with her usual exclamation: 'O Kabuliwala! Kabuliwala!' Rahamat's face lighted up as he turned to her. He had no bag under his arm today, so she could not discuss the elephant with him. She at once therefore proceeded to the next question: 'Are you going to the father-in-law's house?' Rahamat laughed and said: 'Just where I am going, little one!' Then seeing that the reply did not amuse the child, he held up his fettered hands. 'Ah!' he said, 'I would have thrashed that old father-in-law, but my hands are bound!'\n\nOn a charge of murderous assault, Rahamat was sentenced to some years' imprisonment.\n\nTime passed away, and he was not remembered. The accustomed work in the accustomed place was ours, and the thought of the once-free mountaineer spending his years in prison seldom or never occurred to us. Even my daughter, I am ashamed to say, forgot her old friend.\n\nMany years had passed. It was autumn once more, and we had made arrangements for our Mini's marriage; it was to take place during the Puja holidays. With the coming of the goddess, light and peace seemed to fill the house. There was music and feasting, and the house was full of joy. It was the morning of the wedding, and the house was in a bustle. I was sitting in my study, looking through the accounts, when someone entered, and saluting respectfully, stood before me. It was Rahamat the Kabuliwala. At first I did not recognise him.\n\nHe had no bag, nor the long hair, nor the same vigour that he used to have. But he smiled, and I knew him again. 'When did you come, Rahamat?' I asked him.\n\n'Last evening,' he said, 'I was released from jail.'\n\nThe words struck harsh upon my ears. I had never before talked with one who had been in jail, and my heart shrank within me. I felt that his coming was a bad omen. 'There are ceremonies going on,' I said, 'and I am busy. You had better go now.'\n\nAt my words he was about to go, but as he reached the door he hesitated, and said: 'May I not see the little one, sir, for a moment?' His belief was that Mini was still the same. He had pictured her running to him as she used to do, calling 'O Kabuliwala! Kabuliwala!' He had treasured up for her, as he used to do, a few grapes and raisins in a piece of paper.\n\nI said again: 'There is a ceremony in the house, and you will not be able to see any one.'\n\nThe man's face fell. He looked at me for a moment with a sad face, and then he went out.\n\nI felt a little sorry, and was about to call him back, when I saw that he was coming of his own accord. He came close up to me and held out his offerings with the words: 'I brought these few things, sir, for the little one. Will you give them to her?'\n\nI took them and was going to pay him, but he caught my hand and said: 'You are very kind, sir! Keep me in your recollection. Do not offer me money! You have a little girl, I too have one like her in my own home. I think of her, and bring fruits to your child, not to make a profit for myself.'\n\nSaying this, he put his hand inside his big loose robe, and brought out a small and dirty piece of paper. With great care he unfolded this, and spread it out with both hands on my table. It bore the impression of a little, ink-smeared hand. The impression of his own little daughter's hand, who was in the far-off mountains, and whom he had not seen for all these years.\n\nMy eyes filled with tears. I forgot that he was a poor Kabuliwala, a fruit-seller, while I was—but no, what was I more than he? He also was a father.\n\nThis realization of our common humanity was so strong that I at once sent for Mini. She came, and stood before me, clothed in the red silk of her wedding-day, with the sandal paste on her forehead, and adorned as a young bride. The Kabuliwala looked a little staggered at the apparition. He could not revive their old friendship. At last he smiled and said: 'Little one, are you going to your father-in-law's house?'\n\nBut Mini now understood the meaning of the word 'father-in-law's house,' and she could not answer him as of old. She flushed up at the question, and stood before him with her bride-like face turned down.\n\nI remembered the day when the Kabuliwala and my Mini had first met, and I felt sad. When she had gone, Rahamat heaved a deep sigh, and sat down on the floor. The idea had suddenly come to him that his daughter too must have grown in all this time, and that he would have to make friends with her anew. Assuredly he would not find her as he had left her, and besides her, what might have happened to his wife and his home?\n\nThe marriage-pipes sounded, and the mild autumn sun streamed in. But Rahamat sat in the little Calcutta lane, and saw before him the barren mountains of Afghanistan.\n\nI took out a bank-note, and gave it to him, saying: 'Go back to your own daughter, Rahamat, in your own country, and may the happiness of your meeting bring good fortune to my child!'\n\nHaving made this present, I had to curtail some of the festivities. I could not have the electric lights I had intended, nor the military band, and the ladies of the family were disappointed. But to me the wedding-feast was all the brighter for the thought that in a distant land a long-lost father met again with his only child.",

Antonyms**\nAntonyms are words that have the opposite meaning of another word. Understanding antonyms helps clarify meaning and provides contrast.\n\n*   **Example:**\n    *   The antonym of 'hot' is **cold**.\n    *   The antonym of 'fast' is **slow**.\n    *   The antonym of 'begin' is **end**.\n\n**3. Word Formation**\nWord formation is the process of creating new words from existing words, often by adding prefixes or suffixes.\n\n*   **Prefixes:** A prefix is added to the beginning of a word to change its meaning.\n    *   `un-` + `happy` = `unhappy` (opposite of happy)\n    *   `re-` + `do` = `redo` (to do again)\n\n*   **Suffixes:** A suffix is added to the end of a word, and it can change the word's meaning or its part of speech.\n    *   `wonder` (noun/verb) + `-ful` = `wonderful` (adjective)\n    *   `quick` (adjective) + `-ly` = `quickly` (adverb)",

In the workplace, you'll need two types of listening skills: listening for general information (skimming) and listening for specific information (scanning).\n\n**1.

Listening for Specific Information (Scanning)**\nThis is when you are listening for particular details, such as names, dates, numbers, or answers to specific questions.\n\n*   **When to use it:** When a client gives you project requirements, when your manager assigns a task with a deadline, or when listening for your name in a meeting.\n*   **How to do it:**\n    *   Prepare beforehand: know what information you need.\n    *   Listen for signal words (e.g., *'The deadline is...'*, *'The key metric will be...'*).\n    *   Take notes, writing down only the specific details you need.\n    *   Ignore irrelevant information.\n\n**Example Scenario:**\nIn a project kickoff meeting, you would use **general listening** to understand the project's overall goal. When the project manager says, *'Okay, let's talk deadlines. The first draft is due on October 25th,'* you would switch to **specific listening** to note down that exact date.",
