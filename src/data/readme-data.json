              "fullText": "Listen, son: I am saying this as you lie asleep, one little paw crumpled under your cheek and the blond curls stickily wet on your damp forehead. I have stolen into your room alone. Just a few minutes ago, as I sat reading my paper in the library, a stifling wave of remorse swept over me. Guiltily I came to your bedside.\n\nThese are the things I was thinking, son: I had been cross to you. I scolded you as you were dressing for school because you gave your face merely a dab with a towel. I took you to task for not cleaning your shoes. I called out angrily when you threw some of your things on the floor.\n\nAt breakfast I found fault, too. You spilled things. You gulped down your food. You put your elbows on the table. You spread butter too thick on your bread. And as you started off to play and I made for my train, you turned and waved a hand and called, 'Goodbye, Daddy!' and I frowned, and said in reply, 'Hold your shoulders back!'\n\nThen it began all over again in the late afternoon. As I came up the road I spied you, down on your knees, playing marbles. There were holes in your stockings. I humiliated you before your boyfriends by marching you ahead of me to the house. Stockings were expensive—and if you had to buy them you would be more careful! Imagine that, son, from a father!\n\nDo you remember, later, when I was reading in the library, how you came in timidly, with a sort of hurt look in your eyes? When I glanced up from my paper, impatient at the interruption, you hesitated at the door. 'What is it you want?' I snapped.\n\nYou said nothing, but ran across in one tempestuous plunge, and threw your arms around my neck and kissed me, and your small arms tightened with an affection that God had set blooming in your heart and which even neglect could not wither. And then you were gone, pattering up the stairs.\n\nWell, son, it was shortly afterwards that my paper slipped from my hands and a terrible sickening fear came over me. What has habit been doing to me? The habit of finding fault, of reprimanding—this was my reward to you for being a boy. It was not that I did not love you; it was that I expected too much of youth. I was measuring you by the yardstick of my own years.\n\nAnd there was so much that was good and fine and true in your character. The little heart of you was as big as the dawn itself over the wide hills. This was shown by your spontaneous impulse to rush in and kiss me good night. Nothing else matters tonight, son. I have come to your bedside in the darkness, and I have knelt there, ashamed!\n\nIt is a feeble atonement; I know you would not understand these things if I told them to you during your waking hours. But tomorrow I will be a real daddy! I will chum with you, and suffer when you suffer, and laugh when you laugh. I will bite my tongue when impatient words come. I will keep saying as if it were a ritual: 'He is nothing but a boy—a little boy!'\n\nI am afraid I have visualized you as a man. Yet as I see you now, son, crumpled and weary in your cot, I see that you are still a baby. Yesterday you were in your mother's arms, your head on her shoulder. I have asked too much, too much.",

              "fullText": "A stout old lady was walking with her basket down the middle of a street in Petrograd to the great confusion of the traffic and with no small peril to herself. It was pointed out to her that the pavement was the place for foot-passengers, but she replied: 'I'm going to walk where I like. We've got liberty now.' It did not occur to the dear old lady that if liberty entitled the foot-passenger to walk down the middle of the road, it also entitled the taxi-driver to drive on the pavement, and that the end of such liberty would be universal chaos.\n\nEverything would be getting in everybody else's way and nobody would get anywhere. Individual liberty would have become social anarchy. There is a danger of the world getting liberty-drunk in these days like the old lady with the basket, and it is just as well to remind ourselves of what is the rule of the road. It means that in order that the liberties of all may be preserved, the liberties of everybody must be curtailed.\n\nWhen the policeman, say, at Piccadilly Circus steps into the middle of the road and puts out his hand, he is the symbol not of tyranny, but of liberty. You may not think so. You may, being in a hurry, and seeing your car pulled up by this insolence of office, feel that your liberty has been violated. How can this fellow interfere with your free use of the public highway? Then, if you are a reasonable person, you will reflect that if he did not interfere with you, he would interfere with no one, and the result would be that Piccadilly Circus would be a maelstrom that you would never cross at all. You have submitted to a curtailment of private liberty in order that you may enjoy a social order which makes your liberty a reality.\n\nLiberty is not a personal affair only, but a social contract. It is an accommodation of interests. In matters which do not touch anybody else's liberty, of course, I may be as free as I like. If I choose to go down the road in a dressing-gown with long hair and bare feet, who shall say me nay? You have liberty to laugh at me, but I have liberty to be indifferent to you. And if I have a fancy for dyeing my hair, or waxing my moustache (which heaven forbid), or wearing an overcoat and sandals, or going to bed late or getting up early, I shall follow my fancy and ask no man's permission.\n\nBut when we step out of that kingdom our personal liberty of action becomes qualified by other people's liberty. I might like to practice on the trombone from midnight till three in the morning. If I went on to the top of Everest to do it, I could please myself, but in my suburban house I have to consider the people in my street. We are all liable to forget this, and unfortunately we are much more conscious of the imperfections of others in this respect than of our own. A reasonable consideration for the rights or feelings of others is the foundation of social conduct. It is in the small matters of conduct, in the observance of the rule of the road, that we pass judgment upon ourselves, and declare that we are civilized or uncivilized.",

His small shop, filled with the gentle ticking of a dozen clocks, was a relic of a bygone era. For fifty years, he had mended timepieces, his life measured by the steady swing of their pendulums. But now, a new sound filled the city: the silent, sterile hum of electric clocks. His customers dwindled, their modern tastes leaving no room for his antiquated art.\n\nHis pride, the great grandfather clock in the corner, was his masterpiece. Its pendulum, a disk of polished brass, swung with a grace that Shibnath called 'the heartbeat of time.' But as his fortunes faltered, so did the clock. Its swings grew weaker, its chimes less certain. Shibnath saw it as a reflection of his own life, a slow, inevitable decline. He refused to sell it, even when his pockets were empty. 'You don't sell a part of your soul,' he'd mutter.\n\nOne day, a wealthy industrialist, a man who built factories that mass-produced the very clocks that were ruining him, came to his shop. He didn't want a new clock; he wanted Shibnath to repair an old, intricate German timepiece, a family heirloom. For weeks, Shibnath worked, his old passion rekindled. He poured all his skill into the task, his hands steady once more. When he was finished, the clock chimed with a clarity it hadn't known in decades.\n\nThe industrialist was overjoyed and paid him a handsome sum. With the money, Shibnath could have modernized his shop, perhaps even retired. Instead, he bought the finest oils and tools. He spent the entire night tending to his own faltering pendulum, polishing the brass, tightening the weights, and tuning the chime. As dawn broke, the grandfather clock rang out, its beat strong and true once more. Shibnath smiled. He hadn't defeated the future, but he had preserved the past, and for a master of time, that was victory enough.",

It was the story of an old woman who longed to go on a pilgrimage to Kashi but ultimately gave her savings to a young orphan girl for her wedding. My grandmother identified deeply with the protagonist.\n\nOne week, I went to a wedding in the neighboring village and was away for a few days. When I returned, I found my grandmother in tears. She had received the magazine but couldn't read the latest episode of her favorite story. For the first time, she expressed her deep frustration with her illiteracy. 'I am so dependent on you,' she cried. 'I want to read on my own.'\n\nShe was determined. That very day, she set a deadline: by the Saraswati Pooja day during Dussehra, she would be able to read a novel by herself. It was a daunting task for a woman of sixty-two. I became her teacher. We started with the Kannada alphabet. She was a wonderful student, full of enthusiasm and dedication. She would read, repeat, write, and recite. The amount of homework she did was amazing.\n\nFinally, the day of the festival arrived. As was custom, I brought her a gift. But she surprised me. She touched my feet, a sign of respect usually given by a student to their guru, or a younger person to an elder. 'I am touching the feet of my teacher, not my granddaughter,' she said.

Mini, seeing him, was struck with terror and ran inside. But Rahamat was kind. He offered her nuts and raisins. An unlikely friendship blossomed. Rahamat would visit daily, and the two would share jokes and stories. For Rahamat, the little girl was a reminder of his own daughter, whom he had left behind in the mountains of Afghanistan to earn a living in Calcutta.\n\nMy wife, however, was wary. She was suspicious of this strange, large man and feared he might one day kidnap our daughter. I did not share her fears; I saw only the tender affection between the man and the child.\n\nOne day, Rahamat got into a fight with a customer who owed him money. In the ensuing scuffle, he stabbed the man and was arrested. As he was being led away by the police, he looked up at our window, hoping for a glimpse of Mini, but we kept her away.\n\nYears passed. Rahamat was released from prison. It was the morning of Mini's wedding day. The house was full of music and excitement. Rahamat, looking older and wearier, appeared at our door. He had brought a small box of grapes for Mini, assuming she was still the little girl he remembered. I told him to leave, that there was a ceremony going on. But as he turned to go, I felt a pang of guilt. I called him back.\n\nMini, now a young bride, came out. She did not recognize the Kabuliwala. Their old bond was gone, lost to time. Rahamat's face fell. He finally understood that his own daughter back home must have grown up too. He showed me a small, crumpled piece of paper he carried in his pocket: a charcoal-printed handprint of his own little girl. Tears welled up in my eyes. I, too, was a father. I took out some money and gave it to Rahamat. 'Go back to your own country,' I said, 'and may you be reunited with your daughter.'",
